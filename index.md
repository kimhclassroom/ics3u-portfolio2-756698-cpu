# Hi, I'm Asad Khan
Welcome to my ICS3UR portfolio. I’ll use this site to post my work and reflections.

## Highlights
- 🔧 Project 1: **(Digital Citizenship)** – *(Digital citizenship helps promote responsible, ethical, and safe use of technology and online platforms. It encourages respect, critical thinking, and positive engagement in digital communities.)*
- 🧠 Concept I learned: *(Digital Literacy, Online Saftey and Security, Digital/Online Etiqutte, Digital Footprint, Cyberbullying Awareness, ect.)*
- 📝 Blog/Reflection: [Reflection #1](./posts/first_reflection.md)

- 🔧 Project 2: **(Sustainable Computing)** - *(Sustainable Computing helps us acknowledge the impact of e-waste, gives us knowledge on what devices can and can't be recycled, what our families can do to reduce e-waste, and where to drop them in our community)*
- 🧠 Concept I learned: *(Reduce and Reuse, Repairing, Responsible E-Waste Disposal, Donating Functional Devices, ect.)*

## About me
My name is `Asad Khan`, I am taking Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science currently and I live in Mississauga while going to school in PCSS. 
- *Interests:* Playing badminton, video games on my Nintendo, going on bike rides, traveling to different countries, eating cultural foods like Biryani, going on bike rides, hanging with my friends and family, and so much more.
  
- *Goals:* Things that I would like to achive in life would be to probably become a engineer, specifically an electrial engineer or chemical. I also have a bit of an interest in coding, and if I enjoy it very much, I could probably try to become a software engineer too.
  
- *Tools I'm learning:*
1. **Understanding the logic, not just the code:** I need to focus on why things work the way they do instead of just memorizing the frame of the code.
2. **Breaking problems into smaller steps:** I can divide big challenges into simple tasks to make coding easier and less stressful for me.
3. **Practicing debugging patiently:** I will learn to fix errors by testing small parts of my code and reading error messages carefully.
4. **Starting small and testing often:** I will write short pieces of code and check them frequently to catch mistakes early on.
5. **Keep learning through practice and curiosity:** This tool will really help me on trying new problems, exploring examples, and staying consistent to build strong coding skills.
