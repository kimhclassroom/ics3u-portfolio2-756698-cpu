- **Topic(s):** Digital Citizenship

- **What I struggled with:** *Some aspects on the Digital Citizenship presentation that may have brought some trouble on me were:*
1. Trying to find reputable and good informing sources for the information on Online Etiquite which was my chosen topic
2. Images that relate to my topic and the formating on how to make it visual and less so much wordy
3. Trying to look and come up with good examples to portray online etiquitte in situations where it would be most vital to use
   
- **What Iâ€™m proud of:** *I am proud of how I formatted and layed out my presentation and dialogue in a way where  people could understand the basics of Ditital Citizenship and Online Etiquette. I am also proud of some of my real life examples I had shown, and solutions on how you should act/deal with the issue, if you are ever in that situation.*
  
- **Next steps:** *Some next steps that I could take to improve my Digital Citizenship presentation could have been to:*
1. Make the slides less text heavy formatted and just list the pain points to get the message across, without the audience having to read it all and I could explain more
2. I could have spoke more instead of reading entirely off the slides, building and adding on to the information on the presentation and further showcasing my learning
3. Expanded the TRUTH OR FALSE game I made making the questions a bit more critical and complex making you think rather then having simple easy questions with the TRUTH AND FALSE standing out very eaisly
