- **Topic(s):** `Sustainable Computing`

- **What I struggled with:** *I struggled with finding reliable and recent information about local e-waste drop-off locations. It took some time to make sure the details I included were accurate and relevant to Mississauga.*
   
- **What I’m proud of:** *I’m proud that I used real local examples and clearly explained why e-waste awareness matters for our health and environment. I also liked how my answers showed practical ways my family can reduce waste.*
  
- **Next steps:** *My next step is to share what I learned with my family so we can start using drop-off programs regularly. I also want to keep learning about other ways technology can be made more sustainable.*
